# Employee Tracker

The Employee Tracker is a useful way to keep up with employees within a company or job site. This application not only tracks the information, but grows with your company by allowing users to delete, add, or edit employees, departments and roles.

## Description

The Employee Tracker is the product of Sequelize, Inquirer, console.table and more. Therefore, this application can be run right from your terminal. With Inquierer functions to make manipulating the information in this application user-friendly, console.table, Sequqlize and JavaScript bring the app to life on the "back-end."

## Getting Started
